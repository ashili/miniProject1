# <center>Fork</center>
A **fork** is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

You can fork a repo on GitHub. On the upper right corner, simply click **Fork**.

You can also create a local clone to your fork. Just follow the instructions to the [clone](https://github.com/mohamedshabarek/miniProject1/blob/master/pages/clone.md) section!
