# <center>Checkout</center>
You can use `git checkout` on the command line to create a new branch, change your current working branch to a different branch, or even to switch to a different version of a file from a different branch with:
`git checkout [branchname] [path to file]`
The **checkout** action updates all or part of the working tree with a tree object or blob from the object database, and updates the index and HEAD if the whole working tree is pointing to a new branch.
