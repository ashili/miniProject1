# <center>Branch</center>
**Branches** are used to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repo.
After finishing work in a branch, you can merge that branch into other branches using a pull request.
Branches are useful in case of messing up. Anything done on a branch will not affect the default, or master, branch.
